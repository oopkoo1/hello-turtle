1. Use Github API to get all of Hadley Wickham's repo data (username = "hadley")

2. How many stars does he have on each repository?

3. How many open issues are there? 

4. Create a new data frame consisting of just the "owner" column of the resulting data set called `owner_data`

5. Add "owner_" to the name of all of the columns in this new data frame. You can use `names(owner_data) = paste0('owner_',names(owner_data))`

6. Append these columns to the JSON data using the `cbind` command.
