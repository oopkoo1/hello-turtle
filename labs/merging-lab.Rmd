1. Download the samples data on the 1,000 genomes project from our website (https://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/1000genomes.xlsx).

```{r}

```

2. Open the sheet and look at the information listed. Go to the sheet *Final Phase Sequence Data*

3. Read in the first and fourth sheets (you may want to use the `readxl` package). Keep only the low coverage data from the 4th sheet. 

4. Look at the cheetsheet on merging:  http://stat545.com/bit001_dplyr-cheatsheet.html


5. Try merging the data sets with `inner_join`, `semi_join`, `left_join`,`full_join`. 

6. What are the dimensions of the resulting data sets? 

7. The full join and and left join have the same dimensions. Are they exactly identical? 

8. Reverse the order of that sets on `left_join`. Do you get the same result? 

9. Try `anti_join`. What happens? Read here for more on filtering joins: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html
