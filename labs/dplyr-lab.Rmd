1. Download the samples data on the 1,000 genomes project: (https://sisbid.github.io/Module1/labs/1000genomes.xlsx).

```{r}

```

2. Open the sheet and look at the information listed. Go to the sheet _Final Phase Sequence Data_

3. Read the _Final Phase Sequence Data_ sheet. Only read the data for the low coverage samples.  

4. Calculate total sequence by platform

5. Do the same thing by sequencing center

6. Find the subset of samples that passed QC. 

7. Find the subset that passed QC and came from the BCM center

8. Calculate the average aligned coverage for each population on the subset of samples that passed QC that came from the BCM.
