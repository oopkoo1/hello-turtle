This is a lab to practice with Google Sheets and the `googlesheets` package.

1. If you haven't already go to the class Google Sheet and add your information: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KIRtcPVn58R3_qr97WNtcOJiY4AaytHzGDzLW_3_R1s/edit?usp=sharing

2. Use the `googlesheets` package to read in the data like we discussed in class. 

3. Look at the arguments for `cell_rows`, `cell_limits` and `cell_cols`. 

4. Try reading in just the first two columns. 

5. How many students are in the class (or at least have added their information to the Sheet)?

6. Create a logical variable for whether students have more than 2 years of R experience

7. Convert the logical variable from \#6 into a factor with labels "Skilled" and "Learning" 

8. Create a new spreadsheet that is private only to you.

9. Use `gs_auth` to authorize your computer to access that sheet. 

10. Read the data from your private spreadsheet.
